# Bukkit-InfiniClear

Bukkit InfiniClear is a plugin for a Bukkit server that ensures the in-game weather will stay clear and sunny. It is potentially useful for any creative or adventure world, or for hosting minigames. The current version is confirmed to work with Spigot-CraftBukkit version 1.8.8, and will maybe work on later versions without modification. This plugin, if installed, is always-on, and can't be turned on or off through any server commands or configuration.

This plugin uses my Bukkit SimplePlugin Library. The server *must* have that plugin installed for this plugin to work. SimplePlugin can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/ZachOhara/Bukkit-SimplePlugin)

Along with all of the source code, in the root folder of this repository you'll find [detailed documentation](javadoc) and a compiled .jar version of the project.

I may or may not support this software in the future, but feel free to send a pull request if you think you have a way to improve it. There is no warranty on this software, and I am absolutely not going to do full-time tech support for it, but I will try to be as helpful as I can if you're having problems. Send me an email, or create a new issue.
